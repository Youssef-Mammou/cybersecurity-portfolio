# Spoofing Detection  

This folder contains scripts and demo videos for detecting GNSS spoofing attacks.  
Two simple detection methods are implemented and demonstrated:  

- **detection_by_snr.py / detection_by_snr.mp4**  
  Detection based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variations.  

- **detection_by_speed.py / detection_by_speed.mp4**  
  Detection based on abnormal speed jumps.  

**!! Videos must be downloaded to watch them

# Autonomous Mode Switch  

This folder contains scripts and a demo video for the autonomous fallback mechanism.  
When spoofing is detected, the system switches automatically to a safe mode and recalculates the route.  

- **detector_snr.py**  
  Detection based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in autonomous mode.  

- **detector_speed.py**  
  Detection based on abnormal speed anomalies in autonomous mode.  

- **final_map_project.py**  
  Flask + Leaflet map project with real-time trajectory display and spoofing alerts.  

- **autonomous_mode_switch.mp4**
